A solution for the sector/category mapping

If the end-user holds his mouse on a specific crypto currency, we can send a HTTP request to one of the Coingecko API endpoints,
that return multiple core sectors/categories for that specific currency.

- No need for manual dataset
- No need for an insane amount of request (The specific endpoint I'm talking about doesn't allow multiple inputs...)

We can just send a request whenever the end-user wants to view the sector/category of a specific crypto currency.
